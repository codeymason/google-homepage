This is my first complete HTML/CSS project. The assignment comes from The Odin Project's curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css). My aim was to deconstruct and recreate the Google homepage, ideally without too much obsessive attention to detail.

I learned quite a lot, and although I'm far from it, I can see a vague outline of what it might feel like to someday have a strong grasp of these languages. I did more copying than felt comfortable (at a certain point using developer tools to get information about font size and so forth from the source page).

Things to work on in the future: developing a stronger grasp of CSS grids, getting comfortable using more advanced selector combinations, learning about HEX codes and best practices for expressing color, best image filetypes for different purposes.
